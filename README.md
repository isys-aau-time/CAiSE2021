This project includes a test set of time-constrained processes. The processes were generated using a random process generator developed at the ICS group, Department of Informatics-Systems, University of Klagenfurt.

The set is organized in a number of directories, each containing processes of the same size (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 process nodes). File Demographics.xlsx gives additional information on the number of splits and temporal constraints in each process, and the number of nodes in the resulting STNSU. File Results.xlsx gives the measured times for mapping each process into an equivalent STNSU, and for performing the DC-check using the implementation of the DC-checking algorithm from the ICS group, Department of Informatics-Systems, University of Klagenfurt.

The files can be utilized with the Process Tools developed at the ICS group, Department of Informatics-Systems, University of Klagenfurt, which allow visualization, editing, and execution of algorithms for temporal reasoning.

The Process Tools are available upon request.
