# test-processes
This project includes a set of test time-constrained processes. The processes were generated using a random process generator developed at the University of Klagenfurt.
These files can be utilized with the Process Tools developed at the University of Klagenfurt, which allow visualization, editing, and temporal reasoning.
The Process Tools are available upon request.
